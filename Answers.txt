    16. What is the difference between a section and a div? In HTML, <section> means that the content inside is grouped and should appear as a entry in an outline of a page whereas <div> does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.

In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?  To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? A Parent Child Selector is used to match elements that are direct children of other elements, which is a little more precise than the traditional contextual selector. In CSS, every ancestor of the original parent gains access to all the CSS properties through inheritance. In HTML, when an element is placed inside another element, it is said to be nested within its parent element.
    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar? Use descendant selectors:

#sidebar a:link{ color:#134896; }

#sidebar a:hover{ color:#942A5F; } 
#sidebar a:active{ color:#6FB25C}

    24. What is a pseudo selector? Pseudo-classes are used when you may not have a set amount of elements, but you still want to style them individually.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? You can't put block elements inside inline elements. Formatting. By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur (although, as usual, this can be changed using CSS).
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? An element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Default margins, borders and padding are all 0, so when you wrap a div around some text, there is no space between its edges and the text. div elements obey the box model strictly, while adding padding etc. to table cells can be interpreted a bit more loosely by browsers.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default <address>, <article>, <aside> are 3 elements that are display block by default. 2 elements that are display inline by default are <img>, and <input>. <span> is a display inline-block element by default.   
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? The box model is a box that wraps around html elements. They normally are made up of things like margins, padding, borders and the content that goes inside of all those things. The border goes around the elements to make space between elements. The box model starts with the most outer layer the margin, then the border, then the padding, then the content inside.
